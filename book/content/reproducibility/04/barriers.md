# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Barrier 2

Publication bias towards novel findings.

Novel results are not necessarily accurate or interesting but they are rewarded in the academic world! Your article might be less likely to be accepted to a journal or a confence if it reproduces already-published results instead of producing a new set. In addition, if you do not find anything e.g. any significant relationship, you might be less likely to publish, let alone make your work reproducible: as a result, there may be lots of duplicated work going on, where lots of different researchers are asking the same question and not telling anyone what they have found.
