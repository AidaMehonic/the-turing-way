# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Support additional users

Generally speaking, the reason that adding additional users would be a barrier is due to software incompatibility among different users. For example, different users may use different software or outdated versions of programming libraries installed which may lead to problems with running the code. The code should be also easy to use for others, which inlcudes proper comments in the code and good documentation of the package.
