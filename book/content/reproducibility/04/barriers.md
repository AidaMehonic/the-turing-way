# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Being reproducible does not mean the answer is right

By making the code and data used to produce a result openly available to others, our results may be **reproduced** but mistakes made by the initial author can be carried through.
Getting the same wrong answer each time is a step in the right direction, but still very much a **wrong** answer!

It is important to remember that reproducibility is necessary but not sufficient for good quality research.
A critical approach is needed, rather than naively using existing software without understanding what it does.
(See, for example, [a discussion](https://ryxcommar.com/2019/08/30/scikit-learns-defaults-are-wrong) in August 2019 about whether the default settings for Scikit-learn's implementation of logistic regression are misleading to new users.)
Interperability and interoperability are required to properly evaulate the original research and to strengthen findings.
