# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Barrier 1

## Publication bias towards novel findings


Novel results are not necessarily accurate or interesting but they are rewarded in the academic world!
Papers that do not find statistically significant relationships are hard to publish, particularly if the results *do not* reproduce previously published findings.
(That includes statistically significant findings that go in the opposite direction to already published work.)
Similarly, an article might be less likely to be accepted to a journal or a confence if it successfully reproduces already-published results instead of producing a new set.
There's a good chance that reviewers will say "we already know this" and reject the submission.

John Ioannidis published an influential paper in 2005 titled "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False" (doi: [10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124)) which discusses the many factors that contribute to publication bias.
Therefore it is very likely that there is a lot of duplicated work in data science.
Too many different researchers are asking the same question, not getting the answer they expect or want, and then not telling anyone what they have found.
