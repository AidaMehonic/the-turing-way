# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Barrier 3

A researcher aiming to reproduce someone else's work is held to a higher standard, which may affect their motivation to do so. This is because they are encouraged to have greater attention to detail and put the effort into making the work more accessible and usable for others. This is time-consuming, and any mistakes spotted by others may affect their overall reputation.
