# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Barrier 4 : Is not considered for promotion

In the current academic system, a primary consideration for promotion is the proven ability to be awarded grants and recruit students.
Both funding bodies and prospective students value novelty (it is probably part of the human condition!) and this behaviour is reflected in preferentially rewarding papers with a high [journal impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor).
As [discussed above](#publication-bias), this bias towards novelty causes a systematic publication bias.

More broadly, the promotion system in academia tends to reward individuals who have shown themselves to be different than others in their field.
That means sharing code and data to make it easy for "competitors" to do the same work ends up being discouraged by promotion and funding selection panels.
A good example of this bias is the Nobel Prize award which only goes to a small number of researchers each year, and as such ["overlooks many of its important contributors"](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2017/10/the-absurdity-of-the-nobel-prizes-in-science/541863/) (Ed Yong, The Atlantic, 2017).
One of the goals of _The Turing Way_ is to draw attention to the misalignment of the tenure and promotion process with collaborative and reproducible data science.
