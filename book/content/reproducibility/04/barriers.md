# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

|  Some of the barriers to reproducible research. |

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Held to higher standards than others

A researcher who makes their work reproducible by sharing their code and data may be held to a higher standard than other researchers.
If authors share nothing at all then all readers of a manuscript can do is trust (or not trust) the results.
If code and data are available, peer reviewers may go looking for differences in the implementation (compared to how they would have analysed the data) and require additional changes from the authors of the submitted manuscript before it is accepted for peer review.
This problem also relates to readers of a published paper scrutinising the work more carefully as described in the [Plead the Fifth](#plead-the-fifth) section above.
