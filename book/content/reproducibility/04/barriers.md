# Barriers to reproducibility

So far we have described the [importance](../01/importantforscience) of reproducible research and motivated why we think [you should care](../02/whycare).

But there are many barriers to reproducible research.
You can watch Kirstie Whitaker describe some of them in [her talk about The Turing Way](https://youtu.be/wZeoZaIV0VE?t=312) at [csv,conf,v4](https://csvconf.com/2019) in May 2019.
The section describing the slide below starts around 5 minutes into the video.

This chapter outlines some of those barriers, and a couple of suggestions to get around them.

## Being reproducible does not mean the answer is right

By making the code and data used to produce a result openly available to others, our results may be reproduced but mistakes made by the initial author can be carried through. A critical approach is needed, not naively replicating existing work. Interperability and interoperability are required to properly evaulate the original research and to strengthen findings.
