The tasks and responsibilities are listed in a chronological order and have been divided into "before", "during" and "after" the meeting.

## Before the meeting

- Identify a most suitable slot that is time zone compatible for all the members using tools like [Doodle](https://doodle.com/en/) or [when2meet](https://www.when2meet.com/)
  - If you are planning a meeting that includes Americas/Oceania (with over 12 hours difference), consider to have two sessions to avoid holding a meeting in very early or vary late in the day
  - Assign different chairs when holding calls in two different time zones
- Use a standard time with a custom link like [arewemeetingyet](https://arewemeetingyet.com/) or [timeanddate.com](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedform.html) to different time zones when communicating
- Set a protocol for your meeting participants (if there is not any available already), which should include basic etiquette explaining the following
  - Is keeping the webcam and microphone on recommended? Can they be turned off during the call?
  - Is there a password needed to join the call? Can attendees join before the host?
  - How can attendees ensure privacy of their family member? Provide instructions for blurring their background, or using a virtual background?
  - How will attendees be able to particiapte in an ongoing discussion? How can they raise their hands of ask the chair personally?

  - Agenda of the meeting
  - A place to indicate their participation or absense
- Share this document via an email to all the attendees and also add this to a calendar invite so that people have it handy when needed
- The choice of tool should be preferably an open source tool to avoid inaccessibility
  - If using a tool that is available only upon subscription, make sure that all the members have the access information
  - Share a how-to guide to ensure that everyone knows how to use the tool
  - If possible, offer help with installation and testing of the tool in advance

### Designated venues to participate from

*If there are physical office locations, or co-working spaces accessible for most members*

- Reserve conference room(s) (or similar venues) with high speed internet
- Share details on how members can access this venue
- When possible, use individual cameras to simulate remote participation so that those who are not attending in person don't feel left out

  - Test the screen with different light intensities
  - Arrange all the required materials and equipment, like extension cords or power strips

- Remind of the community participation guideline and the Code of Conduct
- Introduce the chair and notetaker, and let the chair take over for the rest of the tasks
- Introduce the format of the meeting and briefly describe the overall schedule, such as the timing of breaks
- If possible, keep the video call separate from chat system to ensure that the speakers are not distracted and the conversations can be recorded on the chat system
- Explain the basic protocols for participation
  - Muting microphone when not speaking
  - Using a chat system during the meeting - if there is one
- Request everyone to keep their camera on whenever possible

- Use breakout rooms whenever possible to ensure that people can connect with each other while discussing questions or issues of mutual interest (more tips below)
- For gathering opinion and response, use silent writing time rather than open discussion
  - Give clear instructions of what's expected from the writing exercises and how long it should take
  - Give reminder in the last minute to wrap up
- Ensure that the discussion is inclusive of everyone, aim to have a fair discussion, don’t fixate on one argument or speaker
- Indicate if the speakers should speed up or slow down, or if there is a technical issue that the speakers should check
- Notetakers should document important outcomes from every discussion
- Encourage everyone to help the notetaker in documenting correct information
- In the last part of the call, create action points and delegate them to different people while on the call
  - Ask people to volunteer to assign themselves to each task, but be inclusive and equitable in this process
- End the meeting on time by thanking everyone and sharing the date for a next call, if any!
- If possible, stay a few minutes extra on the call to make sure that people have a chance to clarify their questions after the meetinf

### Breakout rooms

*If using breakout rooms in Zoom (or similar tool), make sure that each breakout has an organiser to help*
