## Social events

*Checklist for the session lead, helpers and note-takers of the designated session*
- Host loosely themed social events so that the participants know what to expect, most importantly keep the themes fun and informal
- Keep these sessions longer than what they would be in an in-person event, for example, 2 hours lunch instead of 1 hour
- Don't keep these sessions too late in the day, remember that your attendees would not want to sepend extra hours on the online call when they have a family to look after
- Start the online call 30 minutes before the actual event starts, and keep the call running for 30 minutes after the main event is over
- Share the collaborative notes with an agenda, links to join the call from the session or a social event chat system (for example, Slack)
- Start with an informal ice breaker - allow everyone to introduce them to everyone on the call
- Follow the "show, don't tell" format, such as visual artifacts in the session format as much as possible
- Host online games that are not too hard to explain and can be played by multiple people (like Dungeon and Dragons, see [D&D beyond](https://twitter.com/DnDBeyond))
- Other parallel activities such as online treasure hunt, virtual museum or movie viewing can be organised
- Conference dinners can be hosted in parallel in multiple locations - maybe a care package with ingrediate can be sent out before the conference!
  - Other options could be to host a cooking and dining session (see the [Tweet thread](https://twitter.com/kevin_kunzmann/status/1240921979462520834), add your ideas too!).

## Handling breakout rooms

*If using breakout rooms in Zoom (or similar tool), make sure that the organiser helps you create Groups*

- Create groups that are more diverse (they will have a better discussion)
- Remind everyone to give others a fair chance to speak
- Ask them to write notes from their discussion in the shared document
- Send message periodically reminding everyone of how much time for discussion is left
  - Remind them to move on to next person if only one person has spoken so far in their Groups
- When people come back from their breakout rooms, ask them to share main arguments from their discussion
