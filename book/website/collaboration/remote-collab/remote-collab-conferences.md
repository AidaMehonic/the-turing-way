# Organising a Conference or Sprint

This document lists the various tasks for organising a longer event such as a conference or a sprint.
The tasks and responsibilities are listed in a chronological order and have been divided into "before", "during" and "after" the meeting.
Though created for longer events, these detailed task list can be used for planning smaller events that have less logistical requirements.

## Before the event

The different subsections are marked as "Earlier-phase", "Mid-phase", and "Later-phase", based on their importance at the different phases of organisation.
A few subsections are marked as "Relevant for all phases", as those aspects should be taken care of in all stages of event organisation.

### The organising committee for the event

***Earlier-phase***
- To make organising truly inclusive, include different stakeholders from the community, organisation, and members from diverse backgrounds in the committee
- If the organising committee has members across different time zones, the event can be held in a distributed manner
- Have 1-2 committee chairs who can capture the overview of the entire team's work
- Divide the full committee into smaller subcommittees by different tasks and responsibilities
- Identify chairs for the subcommittees and allow members to join more than one subcommittee
- Have a common place for documentation and interaction channels to keep communication transparent

### Website for the event (preplanning)

***Earlier-phase***
*If possible, create a subcommittee dedicated for designing the website and maintaining online communication*

- Take accessibility aspects into account (font size, color, background)
- State everything clearly and in simple words
- Provide contact details of people with clearly stated roles and responsibilities
- Grant edit rights to more than one member in the committee members across different time zones
