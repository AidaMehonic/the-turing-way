# Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

In this section, we walk you through a basic setup of continuous integration using GitHub Actions. **GitHub Actions** is a task automation system fully integrated with GitHub. In other words, it is an API that orchestrates any workflow based on any event. It can make makes it easier than ever to incorporate CI into the repositories. It is a flexible way to automate nearly every aspect of your software workflow. Here are just a few examples of use cases of GitHub Actions:

- Automated testing of the software
- Generate reports of the status of any changes in the repository
- Responding to workflow triggers using labels, issues, `@` mentions, and more
- Triggering code reviews and pull requests
- Managing branches

GitHub Actions are event-driven, meaning it responds to an event (`PR` created, issue created, ...) and triggers an action (label, test, sort, ...). A collection of actions is called a workflow.

## Getting started with GitHub Action

GitHub Actions uses YAML syntax and stored in a directory called `.github/workflows` in the repository. You can either use a templated workflow or create your own.

#### 1- Using GitHub Actions template

If you want to get started with GitHub Actions, you can start by clicking the "Actions" tab in the repository where you want to create a workflow, as shown below.

#### 2- Using libraries-specific templates.

**1. WorkFlow**

The workflow is is a unit of automation from start to finish. It consisits of all the aspects which should be taken into account during the atomation including what event can be trigger the automation. The workflow can be used to build, test, package, release, or deploy a project on GitHub.

**2. Job**

A job is a section of the workflow, and is made up of one or more steps. In this section of our workflow, the template defines the steps that make up the build job.

**3. Step**

Step: A step represents one effect of the automation. A step could be defined as a GitHub Action, or another unit, like printing something to the console.

**4. Actions**

A GitHub Action is a piece of automation written in a way that is compatible with workflows. Actions can be written by GitHub, by the open source community, or you can write them yourself!
